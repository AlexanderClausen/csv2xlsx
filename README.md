# 📄 csv2xlsx

## Introduction

Working with CSV files can be a hassle, especially in countries where the standard delimiter is different from the international comma. For instance, in Germany, semicolon-separated CSVs are the norm. This discrepancy can make it challenging to work with international comma-separated CSV files in Excel and other spreadsheet software.

`csv2xlsx` is a solution to this problem. It provides a simple and intuitive way to convert comma-separated CSV files into XLSX format, making them more accessible and easier to work with in Excel.

- 📤 **Upload CSV or ZIP Files**: The application allows users to upload multiple CSV files or even ZIP files containing CSVs.
- 👁️ **Preview Data**: Before conversion, users can preview the data to ensure everything looks correct.
- 📥 **Download Options**:
   - 📑 **Single File**: Download all data as a single XLSX file, with each CSV file as a separate sheet.
   - 📁 **Separate Files**: Download data as individual XLSX files with a single sheet, bundled together in a ZIP file.
